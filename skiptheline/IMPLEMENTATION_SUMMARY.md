## 🔧 How to Test

1. **Create an event** in admin → Check Firebase
2. **Make a purchase** → Check if passes update automatically
3. **Edit an event** → Verify changes save to Firebase
4. **Add a club** → Confirm it appears in admin
5. **Check revenue** → Should show real data from purchases

The system is now fully functional with real data persistence and automatic updates!
